## About

HBNetMon is a progressive web application, designed for DMR network operators to offer a
 mobile friendly "app" and dashboard. HBNetMon is compatable with HBLink3, FreeDMR, HBNet, and possibly others.

HBNetMon was built with [flet](https://flet.dev), a Python 3 "wrapper" for [flutter](https://flutter.dev), and is highly
 configurable via a yaml configuration file.
